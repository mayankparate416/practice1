        <p className='pt-2 text-start webfont1'>
        We store your Personal Information outside of Switzerland and the European Union. As your Personal Information is transferred to and stored at a destination outside of Switzerland and the European Union, we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that such transfer and storage is in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the applicable data protection legislation to safeguard your privacy.

The Users are required to be careful to avoid “phishing” scams, where someone may send the User an e-mail that looks like it is from FTB Innosphere asking for the User’s personal information. While availing the Services of the Website, the User may have an option to engage certain third party agencies, software or tools (“Third Party Services”) for effective completion of translation service. In the event the User avails such Third Party Services, FTB Innosphere shall not be liable for any breach of confidentiality, acts or omissions of such third party agencies.
